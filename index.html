    <h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>
         <p class="negrita">Eileen,<br>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part</p>
    
    <h3>Starting dates</h3>
        <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if
         you</br>
         could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br>
            <ul class="lista1">
                 <li>Firstsemester: 9 September 2016</li>
                 <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
                 <li>Third semester 2 May 2017</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    

        <p>Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would pfer.</p>
        <p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website.</p>

    <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
         <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall</br>
            somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just</br>
            the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
            intrigued</br>by are as follows, in order of priority:<br>
            <ol class="lista2">
                 <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
                 <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the</br>audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 > 3 x 104.)</li>
                 <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>
    </p>
    

      <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect
        the</br>research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know?
        Thanks.</p>

    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your
         question,</br>my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p><br>

        <div class="word2"><p>Polynesia chicken dance</p>
             <p class="espacio">A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance around</br>
             in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.</p>
             <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
             <p class="espacio">the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which</br>
             involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impcrccptably<br>
             tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired</br>
             modem styles such as Twerking."</p>
             <p>Arctic robot dance</p>
             <p class="espacio"> interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have</br>
             discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic*, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants</br>
             of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this</br>
             because they were really cold.</p>
        </div>

    <p>Yours sincerely.</p><br>
